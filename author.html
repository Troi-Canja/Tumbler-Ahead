					<p> <br> I go by the name Troi Lawrence T. Canja. I am currently a freshman student from Adamson University taking up Bachelor of Science in Information System. I had my first glimpse of the world on April 23, year 2000. I am from Lubang, Occidental Mindoro, the hidden paradise of the Philippines. <br>
					<br>
					For someone who lived by the province for most of my life, I tend to enjoy outdoor activities. Outdoor leisure is one of the best hobby of mine and it leads me to this concept. Especially now that we face pandemic and been warned that health should always be our top priority, I opted to improvise an item that is handy and useful for something that I enjoy. It is a must-have wherever we go. Necessary to keep ourselves from dehydration and is important to keep ourselves away from certain causes such as heat stroke, over fatigue and many more.<br>
					<br>
					More than anyone else, the future generation will benefit from the accomplishment of this vision. Walking in the modern path, it is just vital to maintain being productive without the fear of exhaustion. Smart tumbler will do the job and it is something to look forward. <br>

					<p> <br> Providing a tiny space at the bottom lid of the tumbler allows the user to store little stuffs that suits the space provision. It might be too simple but it creates a big difference.
					<br><br> A tumbler with multiple functions is so superb and will be considered the next-gen trend. You don't have to struggle looking for your keys among the ocean of your clutters.

					<p> <br> It's such an anxiety-trigerring event when you forgot where you've put your device, right?
					<br><br> Worry no more since this smart tumbler is equipped with tracking feature which notifies the user if the user's registered device is out of the 3-meter radius. If the tumbler wasn't informed that your device is supposedly not inside the certain radius, it alarms and/or vibrate that will serve as a signal for you about your misplaced device. If your device's gps is on, you can track it through the tumbler's map. How handy could it be?
